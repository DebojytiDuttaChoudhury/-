I'm thrilled to share my latest case study, where I analyzed Zomato's operational data to uncover key insights impacting customer engagement and delivery efficiency. 🚚🍽️

🚨 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭:
Zomato has been facing a decline in customer satisfaction, increased order cancellations, and inconsistent delivery times across regions. As a data analyst, my mission was to dive deep and provide actionable insights to address these challenges.

📈 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐳𝐞𝐝:
✅ 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐎𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬: 1.0𝐊
❌ 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: 332
⭐ 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: 3/5
💳 𝐌𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝: 𝐔𝐏𝐈 (26.8%)
🏙️ 𝐂𝐢𝐭𝐲-𝐖𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞: Hyderabad led with ₹41.3𝐊, followed by Mumbai.

🔑 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬: 🚫 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞: 33.2% of total orders – Delivery delays and operational inefficiencies were major contributors.
📉 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬: Significant drops observed in June 2024 and September 2024.
⭐ 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬: Most ratings were in the 3-star range, showing potential for improving service quality.
⏳ 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐬: Longer delivery times for cancelled and failed orders indicate operational bottlenecks.

🧮 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐚 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:
For filtering Completed or Cancelled orders, I applied the following calculated field formula:
𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐚:
𝐎𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐬 = "𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐝" 𝐎𝐑 𝐎𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐬 = "𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐝"
This enabled a clear segmentation to identify patterns across completed and cancelled orders.
